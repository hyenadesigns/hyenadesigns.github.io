# Hyenas Knowledge Base

## Intro
Hello i am known as Hyena and i have been modeling since march of 2019, I have started my modeling my modeling journey like many of you, i had to learn on my own or spend hours fixing issues.

### Problem
Nowadays the modeling scene is extremely competitive, and many are unfriendly and only looking for their own gain. Getting answers or help can be frustrating and many new modelers dont know where to look, so they tend to use outdated or unoptimised methods.

### Solution
I have created this document in the hopes of creating an **equal** platform for all to use, it is not the best but i hope it will be something.
